	 * 
	 * 1. Stack: is used for memory allocation and deallocation When
	 * StackOverFlowError occurs; --> When the memory size exceeds more than 1024 KB
	 * in the Stack, then StackOverFlowError occurs. The default size of Stack is
	 * 1024KB. It totally depends on the system configuration that we are using.
	 * 
	 * --> While recursing through a function, if suppose function runs for infinite
	 * times.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * 2. Heap: The object creation part happens in the heap memory.
